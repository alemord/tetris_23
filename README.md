# myTetris2023
### This is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for a classic Tetris game. This code creates a grid, generates geometric shapes and allows the user to move pieces around within the grid.
### I created a variable grid that holds the div elements (200) with a class of grid. The scoreDisplay variable holds the element with an ID of score, and startBtn holds the element with an ID of start-button. 
### The code then defines five geometric shapes, each one with a different color and four different rotation options.
### The shapes include L-shape, Z-shape, T-shape, O-shape, and I-shape.
### If a shape is blocked and can't move down, the game freezes the shape and adds its squares to the taken class, while prompting a new shape to be created at the top of the grid.
